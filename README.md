# Gladiator-Project
This is another Project which is developed by me along with a team of 4 members. Where we used Angular for frontend, Spring Boot for the middle tag and MySQL for the backed. Investment Tracking is a full Stack Web Development Project where there are user and admin roles. User can track their Investments made by the Admin.
